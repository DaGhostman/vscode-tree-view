## Features

- Preview file imports
- Auto-update on file changes
- Color-coded to speed up navigation
- Go To definition when clicking on leaf node*

\* Note there might be slight variation in feature's behavior, but those mainly
come from external library limitations/behavior and will be fixed/normalized ASAP
